In the club, party rock
Looking for your girl? She on my jock
Non stop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black, half-white, domino
Gainin' money, Oprah, dough
Yo!! I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo, we party rock!
Yeah, that's the crew that I'm repping
On the rise to the top, no lead in our zeppelin, hey
Party rock is in the house tonight (woo)
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time (let's go)
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it baby)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you
Shake that!
Every day I'm shufflin'
Shufflin', shufflin'
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money don't be mad, now stop
Hatin' is bad
One more shot for us (another round!)
Please fill up my cup (don't mess around!)
We just wanna see (you shake it now!)
Now you wanna be (you're naked now!)
