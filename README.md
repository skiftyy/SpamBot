# SpamBot

This is a simple spam bot that I created to annoy friends in text message conversations.
The full script can be found under SpamBot.py in the folder.
A windows executable can be found under SpamBot.exe in the folder.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
To make sure that it works properly, follow these steps:
  1. Create a folder called GitHub in your C: Drive
  2. Download this repository into that folder

If this is all done you should be good to go!
Have fun!
